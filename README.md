# Project-3-Analytics

This project emphasizes skills in using Git for version control, creating and managing Python virtual environments, and handling different types of data.

## Setting Up Version Control

### On GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com and log in.
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
3. Enter a repository name (`datafun-03-analytics`) and add a description.
4. Choose public visibility.
5. Click on "Create repository."

### On Your Machine:
1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
2. Run `git init` to initialize a Git repository locally.
3. Create a README.md file with project details.
4. Add the README.md file to the staging area with `git add README.md`.
5. Commit the changes with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
6. Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository with `git remote add origin <repository-url>`.
7. Push your commits to GitHub with `git push -u origin main`.

## Workflow:
- Edit your Python scripts, README.md, or any other project files.
- Add changes to the staging area with `git add <file-name>`.
- Commit changes with `git commit -m "Descriptive message"`.
- Push commits to GitHub with `git push`.
